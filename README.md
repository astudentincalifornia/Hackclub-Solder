# My First PCB design
Did Linux eat your RAM again?! A simple double SR Latch circuit connected to the same reset acts as a simple 2-bit memory. It is controlled by two buttons and reset by one.

## Features
1. Can run LLMs*
2. Vibration
3. Idk why it would ever be needed
*you would need over 128000000000 of this item and need to make necessary modifications

## BOM
1 Battery Holder
4 LEDs
1 Motor_DC
6 NPN 2N3904 Transistors
17 Resistors (220 Ohms)
3 Push Switches
